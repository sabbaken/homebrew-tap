# Homebrew formula for the Reminders <-> Home Assistant sync.
#
# This is the canonical copy. To publish it, either:
#
#   a) copy it into a tap repo -- github.com/<you>/homebrew-tap, in Formula/ --
#      which gives users `brew install <you>/tap/reminders-ha-sync`, or
#   b) tap this repo directly, no second repo needed:
#        brew tap sabbaken/tap https://github.com/sabbaken/apple-reminders-sync-to-home-assistant
#        brew install sabbaken/tap/reminders-ha-sync
#
# `make formula TAG=v0.1.0` prints this file with the release's real sha256
# filled in.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      One more step -- this asks for your Home Assistant address and token,
      shows you which lists it will sync, and starts syncing in the background:

        reminders-ha-sync setup

      You will need a long-lived access token from an administrator account:
      Home Assistant -> your profile -> Security -> Long-lived access tokens.

      macOS will ask to let reminders-cli read your Reminders. Say yes; the
      dialog only appears for a command you run yourself, so answer it during
      setup rather than waiting for a background sync.

      Check on it later with:  reminders-ha-sync doctor
      Stop it with:            reminders-ha-sync uninstall
